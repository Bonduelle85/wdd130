    <h2>Anton Gorokhov</h2>
    <h2>Doc</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Anton. I am from Russia, but today I am forced to live in Uzbekistan.</p>
    <p>I worked as a doctor in Russia for 13 years. That's why my friends call me Doc.</p>
    <p>I am 37 years old and I decided to completely change my occupation and master programming.</p>
    <p>I am independently studying Android application development, Java and Kotlin. </p>
    <p>At the same time, I began my exciting adventure with you, my friends, to get another education. </p>
    <p>I really want to get my bachelor's degree.</p>
    <p>Good luck to everyone, friends.</p>
